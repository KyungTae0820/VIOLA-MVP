# VIOLA – MVP

As the Co-Founder and CTO of VIOLA, I designed and implemented the minimum viable product(MVP) of a modern, workflow-driven CRM SaaS application tailored for the music industry—specifically the sync ecosystem across Film, TV, Games, and Commercials. The platform aims to eliminate the long-standing organizational chaos in demo review and pitching by introducing a structured, AI-powered solution that brings efficiency, clarity, and speed to creative decisions.

- Designed and implemented a full-stack CRM SaaS web application for the music industry, applying object-oriented principles, Clerk-based authentication with webhook integration, and PostgreSQL RLS for secure data access control. 
- Enhanced platform scalability and reliability by modularizing TypeScript and integrating RESTful APIs, while improving UX/UI through Framer Motion animations and iterative team collaboration.
